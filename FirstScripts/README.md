# ðŸ“ˆ Stock Price Prediction with Linear and Neural Network Models

This project compares two approaches to predicting stock prices:

1. A simple **Linear Regression model**
2. A more advanced **Neural Network model** enhanced with real financial fundamentals and empirical uncertainty analysis

## ðŸ“Š Models Used

### ðŸ”¹ Linear Regression (Baseline)

- **Purpose**: Establish a simple benchmark.
- **Features Used**: `Open`, `High`, `Low`, `Volume`
- **Target**: `Close` price
- **Assumption**: Linear relationship between input features and closing price
- **Limitation**: Cannot capture non-linear market behaviors

```python
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_train, y_train)
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
```

### ðŸ”¸ Neural Network with Growth Fundamentals

- **Framework**: TensorFlow/Keras
- **Architecture**: Two hidden layers with ReLU and Dropout
- **Features**: Technical indicators + growth metrics from Financial Modeling Prep
  - Moving averages (MA5, MA10, MA20)
  - Revenue growth, net income growth, EPS growth, etc.
- **Evaluation Metrics**:
  - MSE (Mean Squared Error)
  - MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
  - RÂ² (Explained variance)

```python
model = tf.keras.Sequential([
    Dense(128, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.1),
    Dense(64, activation='relu'),
    Dropout(0.1),
    Dense(1)
])
```

## ðŸ“ˆ Evaluation Strategy (Work in progress)

| Metric               | Description                                                                 |
|----------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **MSE / MAE**         | Measures error magnitude (MAE is more robust to outliers)                  |
| **RÂ² Score**          | Percentage of variance explained by the model                              |
| **Bootstrapped MSE**  | 95% confidence interval for MSE using bootstrapping                        |
| **Relative Error**    | MSE divided by variance of target (normalized error)                       |
| **Residual Plot**     | Visual check for model bias or underfitting                                |

## ðŸ“¦ Data Sources

- ðŸ“ˆ Historical Stock Prices: `yfinance`
- ðŸ“Š Financial Growth Fundamentals: `https://financialmodelingprep.com` API

## ðŸ“Œ Insights & Observations (WiP)

- **Linear regression is simple and interpretable**, but struggles with non-linearity and financial complexity.
- **Neural networks perform better with more features**, especially if they reflect business fundamentals.
- **Empirical validation** like bootstrapping is preferred over classical statistics for deep learning.
- **Residual plots** help diagnose underfitting or model bias not visible from metrics alone.

## ðŸ§ª Future Enhancements

- Add **prediction intervals** (via Bayesian Dropout or quantile regression)
- Model **price movement direction** instead of raw prices
- Integrate **macroeconomic indicators** or **news sentiment**
- Expand to multiple stocks for portfolio-level modeling
